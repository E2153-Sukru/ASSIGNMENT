Task:

Find out if a given year is a "leap" year.

In the Gregorian calendar, three criteria must be taken into account to identify leap years:
The year must be evenly divisible by 4;
If the year can also be evenly divided by 100, it is not a leap year; unless...
The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.
According to these rules, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300, and 2500 are not the leap years.
Write a Python program that prints such as "2020 is a leap year" if the given year by the user is a leap year, prints such as "2019 is not a leap year" otherwise.
Note that; this question is famous on the web, so that do it yourself to get more benefits from it.

    if n % 100 == 0:

        if n % 400 ==0:

            print(f"{n} ia a leap year")

        else:
